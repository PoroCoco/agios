##To implement the WFQ scheduler
1. decide on how we will set the weights, implement it
- we could create a new call
2. modify timeline_add_req in req_timeline.h to replicate the behavior of the TWINS scheduler
3. either make a version of timeline_oldest_req, or create an argument, to make it work for the
case where there is a list of timelines (TWINS does it by hand but that is not ideal)
4. create a constant for it in scheduling_algorithms.h, add a position to the list in
scheduling_algorithms.c (the constant is the position of the list)
5. create the .c and .h, implement the algorithm (see TWINS for guidance, itâ€™s the most similar
scheduler)
6. include the .h wherever needed, adapt the agios.conf file
7. test it
- either use directly or adapt the test/agios_test.c code from the repository
